## Can I contribute?

PRs are very welcome!

You can contribute to software development and/or create translations for the app.

### How to contribute to translating app

#### Method 1 : using GitHub
<hr>

Adding a new Language:

1. Go to [Languages](https://github.com/0xaryan/EyesGuard/tree/master/Source/EyesGuard.Data/Languages) folder and create a new yaml file with name `{StandardCountryCode}.yml` like `en-US.yml` or `fa-IR.yml`. Here is a [List of country codes](https://azuliadesigns.com/list-net-culture-country-codes/) you can pick.
2. Copy the content of `en-US.yml` to the new created file.
3. In the meta part of yaml edit the `Translators` array. Remove the existing translators in the copied file and just put information of yourself.
4. Translate the `Translation` section of file and make a PR!

Modifying a translation file:

1. Go to [Languages](https://github.com/0xaryan/EyesGuard/tree/master/Source/EyesGuard.Data/Languages) and find the language you want to edit using its standard locale.
2. In the meta part of yaml and in the `Translators` array, add yourself as a new translator without removing others from the list.
3. Make your changes in the `Translation` section and make a PR!

#### Method 2 : using Email
<hr>
Use the links mentioned in above method, modify/add translation file, then email it to me: Oxaryan@outlook.com

### üìú RTL Languages

For right-to-left languages like Persian, Arabic, etc. It is not needed to explicitly state language layout in the meta section. Simply use a standard country code, and the app automatically detects if it has right-to-left direction or not and changes the design of elements in app.
